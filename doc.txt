STREAMS
    To  read or write sequentially
    Handy for long file
    by default the size of the buffer is 64 kb
    To control the size you must use highWaterMark as a 2nd arg of createdReadStream function

    const { createReadStream } = require("fs");
    const stream = createReadStream("./content/big.txt", { highWaterMark: 90000, encoding: 'utf8' });

    stream.on("data", (result) => {
    console.log(result);
    });
